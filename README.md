### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
***This project was given to us on day 12 of the Turing program in Mod 1. I worked on the project for 5 days and a total of around 15 hours. 

### Contributors:
[//]: <> (Who worked on this application? Link to their GitHubs.)
***Dustin Gouner -  https://github.com/dustingouner)

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
***Throughout the project I worked with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to build the app and its functionality. Although, I was not able to complete all of iteration two, I found that by building a solid foundation in HTML helps to efficiently work through the css and JS file in order to have the app function and look as needed. 

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
***My biggest win was when I learned how to properly use the dev tools in order to assist with styling so that my page would look similar to the project page we were given. It was a challenge in its self to know exactly what display, margins, font size, etc. was needed to memic the project page. Another win was when I ran into trouble pushing the liked messages into an array. By utilizing the console.log method I was able to pinpoint the problem and correct it.
